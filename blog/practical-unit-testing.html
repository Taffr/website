          <h3 class="blog-sub-heading"> Why unit test? </h3>
          <p> In my experience unit tests are usually an afterthought, even though every developer has seen the value of them, especially when doing major refactors.
          Sometimes the unit tests are required by process (e.g. "you are not merging this without tests"), and writing the tests are simply a "box-ticking" activity, where the developer has no actual interest in writing good tests, which causes the developer to actually hate the act of writinig the tests.
          Obviously this will lead to both bad tests, and a sometimes a culture where quality is perceived as an obstacle to getting things done, rather than a helpful tool that enables it.
          </p>
          <p>
          This can lead to teams that that resents their own practices, much because they never got any practical training.
          </p>
          <p>
          Any developer that has worked in a team that consistently write <l> good </l> unit test recognize the following benefits:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> <b> An executable specification </b> </li>
            <ul>
              <li> Compared to a static one, such as a doc-comment or (god forbid) Confluence page </li>
            </ul>
            <li> <b> Increased maintainability </b> </li>
            <ul>
              <li> A codebase with tests are generally well maintained, because they were written with testing in mind. </li>
            </ul>
            <li> <b> Intent of the original author </b> </li>
            <ul>
              <li> What was the code meant to do, why does it do it, and almost more importantly; what was it <b>not meant to do.</b></li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-heading"> The main reason people find writing unit tests difficult </h3>
          <p> Coupling. The old enemy. </p>
          <p> Coupling between functionality, especially in dynamically typed languages such as JavaScript is the main enemy to writing
